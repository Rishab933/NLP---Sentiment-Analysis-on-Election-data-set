# Indian Election Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides a series of notebooks for conducting sentiment analysis on election-related text data. The project is divided into multiple stages, starting from data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by different methods for sentiment prediction using machine learning techniques.

## Files in this Repository

### 1. **Indian_Election_Sentiment_Analysis_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook is dedicated to **data cleaning and preprocessing**. It prepares the election-related text data by:
     - Loading and inspecting the dataset
     - Cleaning the text (removing special characters, numbers, and unnecessary symbols)
     - Tokenizing the text into words
     - Removing stopwords to improve model performance
     - Performing stemming and lemmatization for normalization

### 2. **Indian_Election_Sentiment_Analysis_method_1.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook uses **Polarity and Sentiment Score** methods to predict sentiment outcomes. It calculates the sentiment polarity score for each piece of text, classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, and visualizes the sentiment distribution.
     - Techniques involved: Sentiment Polarity Calculation using libraries like TextBlob.

### 3. **Indian_Election_Sentiment_Analysis_method_2.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook applies a **Naive Bayes Classifier** for sentiment prediction. It builds a model using the processed data and predicts sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) based on the training data.
     - Techniques involved: Naive Bayes algorithm (MultinomialNB).

### 4. **Indian_Election_Sentiment_Analysis_method_3.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook uses **Logistic Regression** for sentiment prediction. It trains a Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed text data to classify sentiment based on election-related opinions.
     - Techniques involved: Logistic Regression classification.

### 5. **Indian_Election_Sentiment_Analysis_method_4.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook applies the **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** for sentiment classification. It builds and evaluates an SVC model to predict sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) from election-related text data.
     - Techniques involved: Support Vector Classifier.
